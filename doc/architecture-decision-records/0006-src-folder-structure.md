# src Folder structure

## Status

Proposed

## Context

There are too many files in the `src` folder, so some hierarchy is needed.

## Decision

There will be the following folders:

`domain`
: Contains all the core domain logic

`twitter`
: Contains the classes responsible for the communication with the twitter API

## Consequences

No consequences are known at the moment
