# Test Folder Structure

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The question is where the tests for a class should be located.

## Decision

Tests will be located right next to the implementation.

## Consequences

- It might be necessary to adapt when contract tests are implemented, because they are valid for multiple
implementations
